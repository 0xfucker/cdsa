# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository is an ongoing project of implementing data structures and algorithms in C. I find I often use the same constructs in C that require a lot of boilerplate code, so I made this repository to both organize these constructs and allow easy integration of these constructs into my existing projects. Portability is top priority, so only the C standard library is used.

Feel free to use these data structures and algorithms in your own way. The code is licensed under the ISC license (a simplified version of the BSD license that is functionally identical); thus, it may legitimately be reused in any project, whether Proprietary or Open Source.
